<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a PhD student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [René Vidal](http://cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/){:target="\_blank"}. I work closely with [Benjamin D. Haeffele](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/~haeffele/){:target="\_blank"} and [Yi Ma](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to my PhD, I spent two years as a research assistant at [ShanghaiTech University](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Manolis C. Tsakiris](https://sites.google.com/site/manolisctsakiris/){:target="\_blank"} and collaborating with [Laurent Kneip](https://laurentkneip.com/){:target="\_blank"}. I received a master's degree in applied mathematics and statistics from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, and a bachelor's in computer science with honor from [ShanghaiTech](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/){:target="\_blank"}.

My research interests lie in the theoretical foundations of machine learning and data science as well as emerging applications. As such, I develop both rigorous mathematics and practical implementations in my work. In particular, I study manifold learning and clustering, 3D vision and robotics.

I love to [chat about research, life, and fun](https://calendar.app.google/nvvmk8SyRUcHKMvg9){:target="\_blank"}. If you are a student interested in doing research with me, please email me with your CV and transcript. For master's students and undergraduates, the recommended time investment is at least 15 hours per week.
