### As Private Tutor
In a past life, I have also worked as a private tutor for high school students in mathematics, physics, and computer science. In particular, I have tutored students at [Shanghai American School](https://www.saschina.org) for Advanced Placement courses and exams including calculus, physics, and computer science. I have also taught math and physics of the Chinese College Entrance Exam.
