Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Hi there! I am a PhD student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [René Vidal](http://cis.jhu.edu/~rvidal/){:target="\_blank"}. I work closely with [Benjamin D. Haeffele](https://www.cis.jhu.edu/~haeffele/){:target="\_blank"} and [Yi Ma](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to my PhD, I was a research assistant at [ShanghaiTech University](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Manolis C. Tsakiris](https://sites.google.com/site/manolisctsakiris/){:target="\_blank"} and collaborating with [Laurent Kneip](https://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/Director.html){:target="\_blank"}. I received a master's degree in applied mathematics and statistics from [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, and a bachelor's in computer science with honor from [ShanghaiTech](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/){:target="\_blank"}.

<!-- ## Research -->

My research interests center on theoretical foundations of machine learning and emerging applications. On one hand, I use mathematics to **understand when and why existing empirical paradigms work**. On the other hand, these insights allow me to **develop practical algorithms that are more robust, trustworthy, and efficient**. As such, my work typically involves theory, controlled simulations, and large-scale applications. 

You can view [my CV](/cv/) for project highlights, or [papers clustered by keywords](#papers-section).

<!-- - **Trustworthy ML**: understand and control the generation of generative models of multiples modalities; develop algorithms that are robust to data corruptions (noise, outliers, false connections among clusters)
- **Efficient ML**: efficient neural architectures, provably convergent algorithms, 
- **Unsupervised ML**: manifold learning and clustering, representation learning for foundation models, outlier rejection -->



<!-- I aim to develop both rigorous mathematics and practical implementations in my work. Recent projects include 1) geometric 3D vision 2) manifold clustering 3) sparse representation learning for foundation models 4) trustworthy AI. -->
<!-- In particular, I study manifold learning and clustering, 3D vision and robotics. -->



{% details **Reaching out to me** %}
I am glad to [chat about research, advising, collaborations, life, and fun](https://calendar.app.google/nvvmk8SyRUcHKMvg9){:target="\_blank"}. 

**Undergraduate and MS students**: If you are interested in doing research with me, feel free to contact me. The recommended time investment is at least 15 hours per week. Students I have mentored have gone on to PhD programs at UC Berkeley, Hong Kong University, MIT, NYU, and to full-time roles at Google and Meta.
